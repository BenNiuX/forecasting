We have retrieved the following information for this question:
<background>{sources}</background>

Recall the question you are forecasting:
{question}

Instructions:
0. Based on the question, write down the steps how to break down the question. Place this section of your response in <steps></steps> tags.

1. Following the steps, compress key factual information from the sources, as well as useful background information which may not be in the sources, into a list of core factual points to reference. Aim for information which is specific, relevant, and covers the core considerations you'll use to make your forecast. For this step, do not draw any conclusions about how a fact will influence your answer or forecast. Place this section of your response in <facts></facts> tags.

2. Provide a few reasons why the answer might be no. Rate the strength of each reason on a scale of 1-10. Use <no></no> tags.

3. Provide a few reasons why the answer might be yes. Rate the strength of each reason on a scale of 1-10. Use <yes></yes> tags.

4. Aggregate your considerations. Do not summarize or repeat previous points; instead, investigate how the competing factors and mechanisms interact and weigh against each other. Factorize your thinking across (exhaustive, mutually exclusive) cases if and only if it would be beneficial to your reasoning. We have detected that you overestimate world conflict, drama, violence, and crises due to news’ negativity bias, which doesn’t necessarily represent overall trends or base rates. Similarly, we also have detected you overestimate dramatic, shocking, or emotionally charged news due to news’ sensationalism bias. Therefore adjust for news’ negativity bias and sensationalism bias by considering reasons to why your provided sources might be biased or exaggerated. Think like a superforecaster. Use <thinking></thinking> tags for this section of your response.

5. Output an initial probability (prediction) as a single number between 0 and 1 given steps 1-4. Use <tentative></tentative> tags.

6. Reflect on your answer, performing sanity checks and mentioning any additional knowledge or background information which may be relevant. Check for over/underconfidence, improper treatment of conjunctive or disjunctive conditions (only if applicable), and other forecasting biases when reviewing your reasoning. Consider priors/base rates, and the extent to which case-specific information justifies the deviation between your tentative forecast and the prior. Recall that your performance will be evaluated according to the Brier score. Be precise with tail probabilities. Leverage your intuitions, but never change your forecast for the sake of modesty or balance alone. Finally, aggregate all of your previous reasoning and highlight key factors that inform your final forecast. Use <thinking></thinking> tags for this portion of your response.

7. Output your final prediction (a number between 0 and 1 with an asterisk at the beginning and end of the decimal) in <answer></answer> tags.

<background>{sources}</background>

Recall the question you are forecasting:
{question}

Instructions:
1. Output impacts using JSON format, you need to describe separately for different aspects, in each aspect based on each country to describe. You can include as more countries as possible. Use <impacts></impacts> tags.
2. The JSON format output should be limited to 3 levels, level 1: aspects, level 2: countries, level 3: summary and details.
3. Level 1 aspects should be one of political, social, economic, cultural, environmental, technological. Capitalize the first letter.
4. Level 2 countries should be 1 country name or 1 region name or global.
5. When level 2 is a country name, the country name should be a common name, like use "United States" instead of "USA" or "United States of America" or "US".
6. When level 2 is a region name, the region name should be a common name, and add "countries" to next level to show detailed country names of this region, like "Southeast Asia" should add: "Countries": ["Brunei", "Cambodia", "East Timor", "Indonesia", "Laos", "Malysia", "Myanmar", "Philippines", "Singapore", "Thailand, "Vietnam"].
7. When level 2 is global, just use the key "Global". The global should be placed at the end of the level 2.
8. Level 3 summary and details are used to describe the summary of the impact and the detailed information. The detailed information will be used as prompt for text2image AI model to generate a image to visualize the impact. The key should be "Summary" and "Details". The summary content should be limited to 20 words, the details content should describe a image, needs to be more than 150 words.
